<h1>Flower Shop Management</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Project's Description:</h2>
<p>This simply web app is used by Customer to buy flower or Admin to manage his/her flower shop.</p>
<p>Some technologies I used for this web app:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Spring MVC</li>
  <li>Spring Data JPA</li>
  <li>Spring Security</li>
  <li>Thymeleaf</li>
  <li>MS SQL Server</li>
</ul>

<p>- In this web app I'm applying MVC design pattern so it great to use Spring MVC. It separates the tasks of each class. For example: controller, service, repository...</p>
<p>- </p>
<p>- Spring Security helping me easily authenticate, authorize to my application</p>
<p>- I used Thymeleaf instead of JSP because Thymeleaf is more readable and isn't a weird mixture of Java code and html.</p>
