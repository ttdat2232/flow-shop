# Flower Shop Management (in processing)
## Project's Description:
This simply web app is used by Customer to buy flower or Admin to manage his/her flower shop.

### Some technologies I used for this web app:
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- Thymeleaf
- MS SQL Server
- Maven
- Lombok

### Why I used those technologies: 
- JPA helps fast query to get Data from database
- Spring Security helps easily authenticate, authorize for account to my application
- I used Thymeleaf instead of JSP because Thymeleaf is more readable and isn't a weird mixture of Java code and HTML
- Lomok for fast getter/setter, constructor,toString...
